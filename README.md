# Messageboard API

This is a repo for the messageboard API

* You can find a swagger endpoint at /api (for example: http://localhost:3000/api).
* There is also a postman collection inside the root directory of the project: messageboard.postman_collection.json.
* Demo Env vars were pushed to github so you can test the API .
* Database migrations are not needed since the TypeORM package syncs DB changes automatically.




## Installation

Clone the repo 

Run:
```bash
  docker-compose up
```

By default the API will be available at http://localhost:3000
